Python 3 TCP reverse shell application. This tool is similar to netcat in terms of its functionality. The difference between RevShell and netcat is that RevShell only utilizes the reverse shell technique to establish the connection between the server and client.

## Deprecation Notice
RevShell was one of the first Python applications I wrote to understand the basics of TCP socket
programming. This application is no longer maintained (and poorly designed), and has therefore been
archived.

## Warning

This application is still in heavy development and is not yet ready for use as an application.

## Disclaimer

This tool is designed to be used as a remote shell and should be used for legal purposes only. I am not responsible for anything you do with this tool, or for any damage that you cause as a result of its misuse.
